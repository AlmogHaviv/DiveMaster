hi this is a misson that exsit to give you understanding of a few key consepts 
1) rest api 
2) containers
3) monitoring using wlastic
4) mongo db 
5) auth of users
6) data stracturing 
7) real world dev env

under plus
1) ci-cd 
2) hosting in a production env using any one of the big clouds azure/aws/gcp
3) microservice arcitecture 


** read about rest api
** read about get,post, patch, delete
**read about query paramaters, headers, request body
**path parameters
**install postman

in this misson we will build diving app. the app will have few fuatures 
step 1) 
creating our env to develop and the base of our crud app
part 1) (2-3 days of work)
the app will have crud (create read update delete) operations for diving sites
tools that we will need to install:
python (preferably newst version minimom python 3 and up)
postgres(will need it only for the start you are an awsome developer who will use swagger)
IDE (i prefer visual stodio code but is your choice)
pip (need to know how to work with it)

how to acheve this:
built real world development env using venv read about it and why we need it (will elavete your understanding of python)
read on the baisics of rest api what is rest api why we need it and how it works, were we use it(no need to read about graphql)
understand the main routes and http relevent status codes (get 200 post 201 ....)
define the relevent routes and data stracutre to get from our client (in this part we dont act on the calls we dont delete thing from the db yest only defainig the routes and relevent data stracture)

technology:
we are working in a python env our libery for creating the web server will be fast api

step 1)
part 2) (2-3 days of work)
connecting prt 1 to mongodb !!!!
tools:
docker desktop (if running in windows env)
docker (if running in linux env)

how to acheve this:
firstly we will learn about what is mongodb why we need it and why we use it (good practice to understand why to use somthing is to understad the diffrance between other know tech in that filed see postgresql vs mongodb for good incites)
secondly we will need to learn what is container then what is docker well i will recomend you to learn what is virtual mechine then what is container
we will run mongodb instance on our local develeop env using docker 
then we will connect our python code to the db using ODMantic
we will create databse calld dev the data base will hold many collections but for now he will hold divingspots 
divingspot data stracture 
{
id: uuid (auto generated by mongo)
name :string
location:{longitude :number ,latitude:number}
max depth: number
avg water temp winter: number 
avg water temp summer: number 
club that dive in that site: [ clubs names ] (this in the futare will be conacted to clubs collaction in one to many relatenship) 
number of divers : number
watertype: string (slat/sweet)
clearty:number (avrg clarty number represent meters of clear view)
descripthion: free txt (descrabie the site and the diving expirice)
current diraction: (in/out)

avg water temp summer: 16 
club that dive in that site: [ marinadivers , alibaba, mogidivingcenter ] (this in the futare will be conacted to clubs collaction in one to many relatenship) 
number of divers : 3465
watertype: slat
clearty:8
descripthion: {this site is very butiful alot of sharks and grate clarety}
current diraction: in

updateat:2022-02-25T21:19:11.828+00:00
}
feel free to add more filds (like dive type chanel cave reef or site is actvie true/false) 
after creating the data type conect the db to the crud operations and chek that it works
technology:
mongodb as our db 
ODMantic as our Object Document Mapper
dokerrrrrrr to host our db

step 2) 
monitoring our app 
part 1) (1-2 days of work)
tools: 
elk
